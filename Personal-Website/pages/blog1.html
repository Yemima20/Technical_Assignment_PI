          When it's my free time or there is nothing I can do for long run, I

        <h4>Sharpen my skills</h4>
        <br />
        <p>
          There is nothing wrong with spending our free time to do productive
          things by sharpening the skills that we have, especially abilities
          in the IT field, where the field is continuously developed and we
          must remain updated and continue to improve to keep our skills in
          accordance with their needs and can be one of the stages in
          achieving goals. Here some example of activities to sharpen your skills:
        </p>
        <br />
        <ul id="article-list">
          <li>
            <p>
              <b>Know your learning method</b>: actually, this is the basic
              thing that you need to know and look for before you learn about
              anything. If you still have no idea, you can search for
              personality test websites and articles or videos about learning
              methods that suit you. make sure the information you receive
              comes from trusted sources because, in my opinion, there is some
              information that is no longer relevant.
            </p>
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <p>
              <b>Join online courses</b>: My recommendation if you want to
              attend online courses (IT field) are FreeCodeCamp, Code Academy,
              Class Central, EDX, DataCamp, Scrimba, Kaggle, and manymore.
            </p>
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <p>
              <b>Practice</b>: relating to the first point, practice
              immediately after learning, make a mini-project, do exercise, or
              practice the part that you still don't understand repeatedly.
              Don't forget to practice and learn continuously to get maximum
              result!
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Digital Detox</h4>
        <br />
        <p>
          Not all activities always connect to digital world and it's not
          healthy physically and mentally if you keep surfing for 24/7, so be
          free to explore nature, 'touch the grass', see the sky, go to the
          beach, hiking, swimming or any outdoor but less digital uses for
          some times. Don't forget to keep the environment clean after you
          have fun from outdoor activities!
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h4>Doing activities based on my hobbies</h4>
        <br />
        <p>
          In my leisure time, I also do my hobbies. Some that are currently
          outside of my field of study include photography, playing games, listening to music
          singing, playing guitar, watching movies or series and others. Below
          are some photos of the results of my hobby activities:
