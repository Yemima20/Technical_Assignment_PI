            Hello, I'm Gloriaza! <br />Currently a student majoring in
            Information Systems at one of the universities in Indonesia. I
            decided to learn about web and UI/UX when I was in high school,
            specifically vocational high school. Later in college, I also became
            interested in data and how to process data so that it is easy for
            everyone to read and understand. <br /><br />
            The existence of this website became one of the tasks in the
            bootcamp program that I am currently attending, named Bootcamp
            Perempuan Inovasi 2023 in the Fullstack web development track and
            also from this personal website became one of my opportunities to sharpen my skills in HTML and
            CSS. <br><br>
